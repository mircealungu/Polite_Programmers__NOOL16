 % context-sensitive extension of PetitParser is used to define its grammar using parsing expressions

\section{Implementation}
Polite is implemented on top of Pharo Smalltalk. The language interpreter is built using a context-sensitive extension of PetitParser -- a parser combinator framework that uses the parsing expression grammar formalism \cite{Kurs14a-ParsingContext}. 

The current implementation of Polite can be found online and downloaded from  the Zenodo data repository \cite{kurs16-polite}. The repository contains an image which includes the code for the language implementation, a suite of more than 450 unit tests, and a sytax-highlighting code editor that is pictured in Figure 1.
